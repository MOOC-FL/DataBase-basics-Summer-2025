#### SQLite database
- SQLite is a simple, open-source database system that is well-suited for learning SQL. You can easily experiment with SQL-related things using SQLite, and we will use it in the exercises in this course.

- SQLite is a great choice for practicing SQL, but it has certain limitations that can cause problems in real-world applications. Other popular open-source database systems include MySQL and PostgreSQL . They offer a large number of features that SQLite lacks, but are more difficult to install and use.

- Fortunately, moving between different database systems is easy because they all have a similar SQL language.
#### SQLite interpreter
- The SQLite interpreter is a program that allows you to access the SQLite database. The interpreter is started by entering the command on the command line sqlite3. After this, you can enter either executable SQL commands or the interpreter's own commands starting with a period.
